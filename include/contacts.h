/**
* A contact represents two bodies in contact. Resolving a
* contact removes their interpenetration, and applies sufficient
* impulse to keep them apart. Colliding bodies may also rebound.
* Contacts can be used to represent positional joints, by making
* the contact constraint keep the bodies in their correct
* orientation.
