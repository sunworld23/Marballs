====================================================================================================

November 16, 2014:
    - Chris fixed some more formatting, everything Kyle highlighted should be good

November 9, 2014:
	- Kyle added what of Chapter 15 he could.
	- Kyle made note of some issues and fixed some formatting.

November 3, 2014:
	- Charlie added 3 files: collide_fine.h, collide_fine.cpp, contacts.h
	- Parts of the code will be implemented later

October 30, 2014:
	- Chris added one new file, coarse_collision.h (There was a lot of code that was never specified to a header
	  so I didn't know where to add it. I also think that code will be implemented later in the fine_collision
	  section. It talked about using both coarse and fine collision systems together.)

October 25, 2014:
	- Charlie added 4 new files (world.h, world.cpp, fgen.h, fgen.cpp)

October 20, 2014:
	- Kyle got bridge demo to work. [Will list additional changes after group meeting]

October 15, 2014:
	- Kyle debugged several dozen or so errors in almost all files allowing the bridge demo to compile.
	- Bridge demo runs but behavior doesn't match description or screenshots in tutorial?

October 14, 2014:
	- Chris added 2 new files (pworld.h, pworld.cpp)
	- Fixed some small errors in pcontacts.h and pcontacts.cpp
	- Changed some comment formatting in pcontacts.h and .cpp
	- Finished through chapter 8, pick up on chapter 9

October 12, 2014:
	- Charlie added 4 new files (pcontacts.h, pcontacts.cpp, plinks.h, plinks.cpp)

Sept. 28, 2014:
	- Kyle cobbled together the fireworks demo of the particle physics engine.
	- app.h/cpp, timing.h/cpp, main.cpp, and random.h/cpp adapted directly from author source code.
	- Consequently, particle.h's and particle.cpp's developments are mostly completed.
	- engine_core.cpp created. Currently only defines gravity constant.
	- Retained header file position in include folder. Moved cpp's to new "src" folder.
	- Updated some function names and comments.
	- Tutorial-wise, left off roughly around page 72 of the book (95 of the .pdf).

Sept. 24, 2014:
	- Chris fixed engine_core.h, a few bugs existed
	- Time sheet folder exists, separated by months
	- Brenton implemented the rest of chapter 3 particle.h file

Sept. 22, 2014:
	- Kyle updated engine_core.h with content up to the beginning of Chapter 3 (pg. 42-43 of tutorial).
	- Added particle.h for someone to fill when they get the chance.
	- Version History exists.
	- README.md actually contains useful information.

Sept. 19, 2014:
	- Kyle reformatted comments to be nitpicky and clean.

Sept. 17, 2014:
	- Chris updated and renamed Engine_Core.h to engine_core.h.
	- Chris updated and renamed Decimal_Precision.h to decimal_precision.h.

Sept. 15, 2014:
	- Charlie performs the initial commit. Mr. Sun says, "Let there be light."
